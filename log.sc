;;; (theourgia log) -- the log layer: segments, manifests, replay,
;;; append, publication and the snapshot frame.
;;;
;;; THIS FILE IS BEING BUILT IN PIECES, and this is the first: whole-file
;;; atomic replacement, segment enumeration, and the manifest. They come
;;; first because everything above them is stated in terms of them --
;;; which segments participate in loading is a manifest question, and
;;; every small file this library replaces goes through one primitive.
;;;
;;; ONE ATOMIC WRITE, AND IT IS OURS. Section 4.5 names a single
;;; sequence for every whole-file replacement (meta, instance, owner,
;;; retired, published, quarantine, the registry, snapshots):
;;;
;;;   tmp -> write-all! -> fsync file -> rename over -> fsync directory
;;;
;;; built on this library's own FFI rather than on (igropyr durable),
;;; and the reason is not preference. Fault injection has to be able to
;;; reach these writes -- L18 and L19 exist to break exactly them -- and
;;; that helper has no injection seam. One implementation, one place to
;;; inject.
;;;
;;; WHICH SEGMENTS PARTICIPATE IS NOT THE SAME QUESTION AS WHICH FILES
;;; EXIST, and conflating them is how an unfinished publication becomes
;;; history. For another writer, a segment counts only if `published.sexp`
;;; lists it (section 9.6): a file that exists but is unlisted is a
;;; publication that did not finish, and loading ignores it so that the
;;; next synchronisation can redo it. For the local writer there is no
;;; manifest -- it owns its own directory and every well-named segment
;;; in it counts. A retired local writer is read by the prefix its
;;; `retired.sexp` records, extended later by published segments that
;;; verify against it.
;;;
;;; THE CURRENT SEGMENT IS THE HIGHEST-NUMBERED ONE. No renaming, no
;;; mode bits, no marker file: rotation creates N+1 and that is the
;;; whole of the state change, so recovery has only two observable
;;; states and both are legal (section 4.4).

  ;; ---- errors -------------------------------------------------------------

  ;; A RECORD, NOT A TAGGED VECTOR, and deliberately unlike the rest of
  ;; this tree. (igropyr durable)'s own comment records a sibling vector
  ;; that grew from two fields to three, after which callers matching on
  ;; vector-length failed silently against the new one. This one has six
  ;; things to say on the day it is written and will grow; a record
  ;; cannot be mis-destructured, and adding a field to it does not
  ;; quietly change what an existing reader sees.
  ;;
  ;; Filesystem failures still arrive as (theourgia ffi)'s
  ;; #(durable-error op (target . errno)). Two shapes, because they are
  ;; two kinds of fact: one is "this log is not what it should be", the
  ;; other is "the world refused". A caller wanting both catches both.
  ;; R6RS derives make-log-error, log-error? and the five accessors from
  ;; this form; naming them again by hand would be a second declaration

  ;; rename lives in the kernel's memory and a crash can leave neither
  ;; the old contents nor the new.
  ;;
  ;; THE TEMPORARY IS LEFT BEHIND WHEN A LATER STEP FAILS. Its contents
  ;; are complete once the write returns, and the target still holds
